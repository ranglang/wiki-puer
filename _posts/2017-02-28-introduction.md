### Layer

Layers are the basic containers.
To create a layer, use the ```new``` keyword. Every layer has a set of default properties: a blue background, and a default width and height of 100.
``` coffeescript
A = new Layer
```

output of html

``` html
<div class="tree">
  <a class="A">Text</a>
</div>
```

it has defualt style as following.

``` css
.tree{
display: flex;
width: 640.0px;
height: 780.0px;
margin-left: auto;
background-color: white;
margin-right: auto;
}
.A{
display: flex;
background-color: blue;
height: 100.0px;
width: 100.0px;
}
```

#### layer.parent
user keyword ```parent``` to specify the generation.

## How to use import the code in any projects.
recently, puer studio just cound generate code for **html** and **vdom**ã€‚

- Step 1, preview the code.
click **preview** button will open a tab for preview your design. You can check your design here.

-  Step 2. import the files (recommends)


As [Puer Studio] is developed on the top of [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) (a modern CSS framework based on Flexbox), maybe you should import the file to your project.

And [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) is used in Puer for makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards( according to normalize's words).

so before you paste the code into your project. import the files.
``` html
<link rel=stylesheet type="text/css" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bulma/0.3.1/css/bulma.css">
<link rel=stylesheet type="text/css" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/normalize/5.0.0/normalize.min.css">
```
- Step 3. paste the generate code

if you need more support for any language and framework, let me know in [issue](https://github.com/ranglang/dumbframer).

 the code for vdom.
``` javascript
  div('.A', {style: {width: "100px"}}, [])
```


## Set properties

To set CC style properties for the layer. you simple type ``propertyName : value```

```
A = new Layer
  backgroundColor: 'white'
```
